          is” and “as available” basis. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the BubbleApp Parties disclaim all
          warranties, conditions, and representations of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including
          those related to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and arising out of course of
          dealing or usage of trade.
        </p>
        <p> 2. In particular, the BubbleApp Parties make no representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of
          content available on or through our Site or the content of any social media platform or third-party website linked to

          errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury, property damage, or other harm resulting from your
          access to or use of our Site; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers, any personal information, or
          user data; (iv) any interruption of transmission to or from our Site; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the
          like that may be transmitted on or through our Site; or (vi) any damages, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities of
          any kind incurred as a result of any content posted or shared through our Site.
        </p>
        <p> 3. You acknowledge and agree that any material or information downloaded or otherwise obtained through our Site,
          including any BUBBLEAPP Video, is done at your own risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages,
          losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities arising from or in connection with doing so. No advice or information, whether
          oral or written, obtained by you from us or through our Site, including through a BUBBLEAPP Video, will create any
          warranty not expressly made by us.
        </p>
        <p> 4. You acknowledge and agree that when using our Site, you will be exposed to content from a variety of sources, and
          that BubbleApp is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, legality, or intellectual property rights of
          or relating to any such content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that is
          inaccurate, offensive, indecent, objectionable, or harassing, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal
          or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against any BubbleApp Party with respect thereto.
        </p>
        <p> 5. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that in no event will any BubbleApp
          Party be liable to you or to any third party for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages
          (including for loss of profits, revenue, or data) or for the cost of obtaining substitute products, arising out of or
          in connection with these Terms, however caused, whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract,
          warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and whether or not BubbleApp has been advised
          of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p> 6. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, our total cumulative liability to you or any third party under
          these Terms, including from all causes of action and all theories of liability, will be limited to and will not exceed
          the fees actually received by BubbleApp from you during the 12 months preceding the claim giving rise to such
          liability.
        </p>
        <p> 7. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If those laws apply to you,
          some or all of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you might have additional rights.
        </p>
        <p> 8. You agree that the limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain
          between BubbleApp and you.
        </p>
        <p> Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
        </p>
        <p> 1. Arbitration: You and BubbleApp agree to resolve any disputes between you and BubbleApp through binding and final
          arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and BubbleApp each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any
          controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and BubbleApp relating to these Terms or our
          Site (each a “Claim,” and collectively, “Claims”). Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance
          with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by
          a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing, will include the arbitrator’s reasons for the
          decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
          parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element
          of it (including any pleadings, briefs, or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral
          submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required
          in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities
          regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
        </p> 2. Costs and Fees: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
        litigation, BubbleApp will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as
        the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the
        arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such
        amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
        <p> 3. No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or BubbleApp from seeking action by federal,
          state, or local government agencies. You and BubbleApp each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small
          claims court. In addition, you and BubbleApp each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
          provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be
          deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration
          as provided in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p> 4. No Class Representative or Private Attorney General: You and BubbleApp each agree that with respect to any Claim,
          neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general, or (ii) participate as a member of a class
          of claimants. You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide
          only individual Claims (whether brought by you or BubbleApp). The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of
          other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision
          will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not
          possible, will be severed and the remainder of this will continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision
          of this will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or
          requirement. Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms. This will survive the
          termination of your relationship with BubbleApp.
        </p>
        <p> 6. LIMITATIONS: This limits certain rights, including the right to maintain certain court actions, the right to a
          jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery
          except as provided in AAA rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. In addition, other rights that
          you or BubbleApp would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p> Other Provisions </p>
        <p> 1. Force Majeure: Under no circumstances will any BubbleApp Party be liable for any delay or failure in performance
          due in whole or in part to any acts of God (such as earthquakes, storms, floods, etc.), epidemics, natural disasters,
          unavoidable accidents, internet and communication service interruptions, laws, rules, regulations or orders of
          government authorities, acts of war (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, blockades, civil disturbances,
          embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond the reasonable control of any BubbleApp Party.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
          State of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions. You agree that any action of
          whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site will be filed only in the state or federal courts
          located in Chicago, Illinois. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
          any such action.
        </p>
        <p> 3. Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
          deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will
          be severed from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.
        </p>
        <p> 4. No Waiver or Amendment: The failure by BubbleApp to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          prevent BubbleApp from enforcing such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to modify these Terms.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Assignment: BubbleApp may, at any time, assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, including to an
          affiliated entity or in connection with a sale of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other
          transaction, or by operation of law.
        </p> 6. Miscellaneous: The term “including” in these Terms will be interpreted broadly and will mean “including, without
        limitation.” Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when interpreting these Terms.

        <p> BUBBLEAPP CUSTOMER REFERRAL PROGRAM </p>
        <p> These Additional Terms (which are Additional Terms as described in Section 5 of the Site Terms of Service (“Site
          Terms”) govern your use of the Customer Referral Program (defined below). “You” and “User” refers to you as a user of
          the Site and of the Customer Referral Program.
        </p>
        <p> • We provide each User who has created a Site account with a unique referral URL (“URL”) that may be shared with the
          User’s friends, family members, or other personal contacts and used by them when they create a User Site account for
          the first time, pursuant to the terms set out below (“Customer Referral Program”).
        </p>
        <p> • Participation in the Customer Referral Program is limited to: (a) each User; and (b) User’s friends, family
          members, or personal contacts who have never either: (i) purchased a BubbleApp Video, DM, or Sticker (even without
          creating a Site account); or(ii) created a Site account. Employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and
          representatives of BubbleApp may not participate.
        </p>
        <p> • For each eligible friend, family member, or personal contact who creates a User Site account for the first time
          using your URL (each, a “Referred User”), BubbleApp will issue a one-time credit to the Referred User and, after the
          Referred User’s first purchase of a BubbleApp Video priced at the minimum amount specified or more, to you (each, a
          “Customer Referral Credit”) as described below:
        
        </p>
        <p> • After the Referred User creates a Site account, BubbleApp will issue a Customer Referral Credit to the Referred
          User’s Site account (in approximately one or two business days); and
        </p>
        <p> • After the Referred User makes their first request on the Site for a BubbleApp Video priced at the minimum amount
          specified or more (a BubbleApp Video only; not a BubbleApp Direct, Sticker, or merchandise) and that request is paid
          for and fulfilled (excluding any BubbleApp Video for which a promo code was used and, at BubbleApp’s discretion, that
          was subject to a promotion), BubbleApp will issue a Customer Referral Credit for that Referred User to the referring
          User’s (your) account (in approximately one or two business days from the date on which the request for the BubbleApp
          video was fulfilled).
        </p>
        <p> 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Additional Terms, you acknowledge and agree that:
        </p>
        <p> • a new User will not be one of your Referred Users under the Customer Referral Program and no Customer Referral
          Credit will be due to that new User or you if:
        </p>
        <p> • your URL is not used when a new User creates a new Site account; </p>
        <p> • your friend, family member, or personal contact has previously either purchased a BubbleApp Video, DM, or Sticker
          (with or without creating a Site account) or created a Site account, (with or without another URL), whether or not, in
          either case, under the same or different name or email address, or otherwise; or
        </p>
        <p> • anyone else has received or is receiving a Customer Referral Credit in connection with that friend, family member,
          or personal contact.
        </p>
        <p> 2. each new User may have only one referring User, and we are not obligated to pay more than one Customer Referral
          Credit to each Referred User for creation of a Site account or to pay a Customer Referral Credit to more than one
          referring User with respect to any Referred User.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Any Customer Referral Credit received from BubbleApp will be maintained in your Site account and may be redeemed
          only for your purchase of a BubbleApp Video, DM, or Sticker (not BubbleApp merchandise) from our Site. If your Site
          account has a credit balance when you make a purchase while logged into your Site account, the balance will be
          redeemed for that purchase (until fully redeemed) and your payment card will be charged for any remaining portion of
          the purchase price; any remaining balance will remain in your Site account to be redeemed for your next purchase. If
          you have a credit balance in your Site account, you may not use a promo code and, at BubbleApp’s discretion, might not
          be able to participate in an offering that is subject to a promotion. A credit balance is not refundable, may not be
          redeemed for cash, cannot be transferred, cannot be used outside of the Site, and expires or extinguishes immediately
          when redeemed.
        </p>
        <p> 6. The Customer Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and you may share your URL only with your
          personal connections. You may not advertise your URL or share it with anyone other than your friends, family, or other
          personal contacts. The Customer Referral Program cannot be used for any commercial purpose, including affiliate lead
          generation. The Customer Referral Program is void where prohibited by law.
        </p>
        <p> 7. You represent and warrant that when you share your URL with your personal connections, you will: (a) distribute
          it in a personal manner; (b) not distribute it in a bulk manner; and (c) not create or send any unsolicited commercial
          email or a “spam” message under any applicable law or regulation. Any sharing that does not meet these requirements is
          expressly prohibited and constitutes grounds for immediate termination of your Site account, including deletion of any
          Customer Referral Credits, and your participation in the Customer Referral Program. Any Site account created using a
          URL that was distributed through an unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Customer Referral Fees issued in
          connection with that Site account may be revoked.
        </p>
        <p> 8. We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any Referred User’s Site account, cancel all related
          Customer Referral Credits, and seek repayment, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that either you or the
          Referred User has: (a) tampered with the Customer Referral Program; (b) used (or attempted to use) the Customer
          Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, unsportsmanlike, or otherwise questionable or suspicious manner;
          (c) breached any of these Additional Terms; or (d) violated any law or regulation or infringed or violated the rights
          of any third party.
        </p>
        <p> 9. Credits do not expire, but the terms of the Customer Referral Program are subject to change at any time, for any
          reason, in our sole discretion. BubbleApp reserves, at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion to:
        </p>
        <p>
          • suspend or terminate the Customer Referral Program;
        </p>
        <p> • disqualify anyone from participating in the Customer Referral Program; and
        </p>
        <p> • revoke, refuse to issue, or refuse to redeem any Customer Referral Credits that we suspect were generated through
          improper channels or in violation of these Additional Terms.
        </p>
        <p> Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in connection
          with the Customer Referral Program and suspend your Site account, revoke all Customer Referral Fees, or take other
          action in our sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p> 10. By participating in the Customer Referral Program, you agree to release and hold harmless BubbleApp Parties from
          and against any and all economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs, or expenses, including property
          damage, that arise from or relate in any way to the Customer Referral Program. THIS SECTION 10 APPLIES ONLY TO
          ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL INJURY.
        
        </p>
        <p> TEXT MESSAGING AND DISCLOSURES
        </p>
        <p> BubbleApp offers various text messaging programs, which may include recurring, occasional, one-time, or
          limited-duration text messages.
        </p>
        <p> Our text messaging programs are open only to legal residents of the United States who are 13 years of age or older.
          Your participation in a BubbleApp text messaging program is subject to our Site Terms of Service (including, without
          limitation, the arbitration agreement and class action waiver) and Privacy Policy. If there is any inconsistency
          between the Site Terms and these Additional Terms, these Additional Terms will apply.
        </p>
        <p> You may sign up for a text messaging program through our website or by otherwise providing your consent. You may
          need to confirm your consent by replying to an initial text message sent to you by BubbleApp. The text messaging
          program may relate specifically to a purchase you have made or to a specific BubbleApp promotion. By signing up, you
          agree to receive text messages from BubbleApp related to that program, such as updates on a purchase, offers, deals,
          alerts, reminders, or other pertinent information.
        </p>
        <p> Message and data rates may apply. Messages may be in SMS or MMS format and may be sent using an automatic telephone
          dialing system. Consent to receive text messages is not required as a condition of purchase. To stop transactional
          text messages from BubbleApp, reply STOP to message received; to stop promotional text messages, text STOP. If you
          reply or text STOP, you may receive a text message confirmation.
        </p>
        <p> Supported mobile operators: Certain mobile operators do not support text messaging services. If your mobile operator
          does not, you will not be able to receive text messages from BubbleApp. In addition, pre-paid users may not be able to
          participate, so you should check with your mobile service provider. Neither BubbleApp nor a mobile operator is liable
          for delayed or undelivered messages.
        </p>

        <p> 3. Right to Remove BUBBLEAPP Videos of Other Offerings: You acknowledge and agree that we cannot restrict the use of
          your BUBBLEAPP Videos or other offerings by the Users for whom you created them or by any third party with whom they
          have already been shared (including Recipients) and we have no obligation to remove those uses (including from social
          media channels or third-party websites or platforms). If we do seek to remove a BUBBLEAPP Video of other offering from
          a social media channel or third-party website or platform, we may notify you of our intent to do so. As owner of the
          copyright in your Talent Content, you hereby authorize BubbleApp to act as your agent in order to submit any DMCA
          notice or other demand with respect to your BUBBLEAPP Videos or other offerings. You will promptly notify us if you

          by BubbleApp in writing. Please note that the licenses granted in this section are fully-paid and royalty free,
          meaning we do not owe you anything in connection with the use of your Talent Content, by us, Users, or third parties
          (including Recipients and, in the case of a Business BUBBLEAPP Video, the Business), other than the payment set forth.
          We may exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the universe. We may sublicense our rights as needed to
          provide and promote our Site or otherwise in accordance with these Terms, and Users may sublicense their rights
          subject to the terms. Finally, the licenses granted in this section are perpetual, meaning that the rights granted

          (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) of any kind or nature, arising from, out of, in connection with, or
          relating to: (a) these Terms; (b) use of our Site; (c) your negligence, misconduct, or fraud; (d) any action or
          inaction by you or anyone acting on your behalf; (e) any Organization or Affiliated Talent; (f) any Charity; (g) your
          status as a parent or legal guardian of a Talent User; (h) Talent Content; (i) Feedback; (j) your eligibility with the

          reasonably cooperate with us in connection with any claim.
        </p>
        <p> Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
        </p>
        <p> 1. Arbitration: You and BubbleApp agree to resolve any disputes between you and BubbleApp through binding and final
          arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and BubbleApp each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any
          controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and BubbleApp relating to these Terms or our
          Site (each a “Claim,” and collectively, “Claims”). Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance
          with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by
          a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing, will include the arbitrator’s reasons for the
          decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
          parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element
          of it (including any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral
          submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required
          in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities
          regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Costs and Fees: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
          litigation, BubbleApp will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration
          as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award,
          the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such
          amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
        </p>
        <p> 3. No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or BubbleApp from seeking action by federal,
          state, or local government agencies. You and BubbleApp each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small
          claims court. In addition, you and BubbleApp each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
          provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be
          deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration
          as provided in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p> 4. No Class Representative or Private Attorney General: Each of you and BubbleApp agree that with respect to any
          Claim, neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general; or (ii) participate as a member of
          a class of claimants. You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can
          decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or BubbleApp). The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the
          claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that
          provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is
          not possible, will be severed and the remainder of this section will continue in full force and effect. No waiver of
          any provision of this section will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party
          waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms. This
          section will survive the termination of your relationship with BubbleApp.
        </p>
        <p> 6. 30-Day Opt-Out Right: You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending,
          within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement, written notice of your decision. Your
          notice must include your name and address, any usernames, each email address you have used to set up an account on our
          Site, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You agree that if you opt
          out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this
          Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in
          the future, with us.
        </p>
        <p> 7. LIMITATIONS: This section limits certain rights, including the right to maintain certain court actions, the right
          to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in
          discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. In addition, other
          rights that you or BubbleApp would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p> Other Provisions
        </p>
        <p> 1. Force Majeure: Under no circumstances will any BubbleApp Party be liable for any delay or failure in performance
          due in whole or in part to any acts of God (such as earthquakes, storms, floods, etc.), epidemics, natural disasters,
          unavoidable accidents, cybersecurity incidents, internet or communication service interruptions, laws, rules,
          regulations or orders of government authorities, acts of war (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, blockades,
          civil disturbances, embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond the reasonable control of any BubbleApp
          Party.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
          State of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions. You agree that any action of
          whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site will be filed only in the state or federal courts
          located in Chicago, Illinois. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
          any such action.
        </p>
        <p> 3. Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
          deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will
          be severed from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.
        </p>
        <p> 4. No Waiver or Amendment: The failure by BubbleApp to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          prevent BubbleApp from enforcing such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to modify these Terms.
        </p>
        <p> 5. Assignment: BubbleApp may, at any time, assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, including to an
          affiliated entity or in connection with a sale of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other
          transaction, or by operation of law.
        </p>
        <p> 6. Miscellaneous: The term “including” in these Terms will be interpreted broadly and will mean “including, without
          limitation.” Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when interpreting these Terms.

          such as third-party websites, online properties, platforms, social media, or systems, which are each governed by the
          privacy policy and business practices of the third party. You understand and agree that BubbleApp is not responsible
          for the security, privacy, or business practices of any third party.

        <p>
          We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Site, and sometimes from third parties.
          Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider
          information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name,
          telephone number, and e-mail address), as well as additional information, including IP addresses and cookie
          identifiers, where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information that we consider to be non-personal with
          personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Note
          that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to
          a code. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

          enable other methods such as logging in through one of your existing social media accounts such as Facebook,
          Instagram, and Twitter (collectively, “Social Media Platforms”) or your Apple ID. BubbleApp also collects certain
          information relating to any Social Media Platform account or Apple ID that you use to login to or link to your
          BubbleApp account (such as your username, bio, and number of followers), although linking any such account to your
          BubbleApp account or logging into BubbleApp via such account is entirely up to you. We may store payment information
          (such as credit or debit card details) but only if you choose to save it to your account. If you create an account
          using a BubbleApp-provided referral link or code through one of our referral programs, we also receive certain

        </p>
        <p> 8. Administrative Reasons, To Enforce and Protect Legal Rights
        </p>
        <p> • To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will disclose your personal information pursuant to a law,
          regulation, court order, or other legal request or process, such as disclosure to law enforcement or other government
          officials or agencies in connection with any investigation, for example of fraud, intellectual property infringement,
          or any other activity that is or may be illegal or may expose BubbleApp, you, or another to legal liability. This
          disclosure may include legal requests from a jurisdiction outside of the United States when we have a good faith
          belief that the response is required by law, regulation, court order, or other legal request or process in that
          jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally-recognized standards.
        </p>
        <p> • We will disclose your personal information when necessary to exercise, enforce, establish, or defend our legal
          rights. For example, we may review your account information in order to investigate allegations of hacking or a breach
          of the applicable Terms of Service. We will disclose your personal information to our legal and other advisors,
          consultants, and law enforcement or other government entities.
        </p>
        <p> 9. Protecting Others
        </p>
        <p> We will disclose your personal information to third parties when we believe the disclosure is necessary to protect
          rights, property, or safety of another. For example, we disclose personal information relating to a Site account if we
          in good faith believe that a Site account is being used in ways that are harmful to another or contrary to the
          applicable Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p> 10. Business Transfers

        <p> In evaluating or engaging in a sale of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other
          transaction, we reserve the right to disclose, transfer, or assign your personal information and communications. By
          providing your personal information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without
          your further consent.

        <p> Our Site is intended for a general audience and not for use by anyone younger than the age of 13 in the United
          States (or under the applicable legal age outside of the United States). We do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children younger than the age of 13 (or under the applicable legal age outside of the United States),
          without the consent of a parent or legal guardian; if we learn that we have done so, we will promptly remove the
          information from our active databases. If you are a parent or legal guardian who believes that we have collected or
          used your child’s personal information without your consent, please contact us.

        <p> Third-Party Advertising and Analytics Companies and Your Choices
        </p>
        <p> BubbleApp works with third party network advertisers, ad agencies, and other advertising partners to serve BubbleApp
          ads online. We may use information we have learned about you to target ads to you and to allow third parties to target
          ads to you. We also use third party analytics providers to provide us with information regarding the use of the Site
          and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies on
          your device (including cookies and web beacons), and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about
          you, including Usage Information. We and our third-party advertising and analytics providers may collect personal
          information over time when you visit the Site or other online websites and services.
        
        </p>
        <p> We may share non-personal information, including information that has been de-identified, aggregated user
          statistics, and Usage Information, directly or indirectly through third party business providers, with third party
          advertising companies, analytics providers, and other third parties, including for the purpose of serving you more
          relevant ads. We may retain third party providers to help us perform these tasks. For example, we may share personal
          information with third parties who combine and link information from BubbleApp with information from other sources.
          These third-party providers may then make non-personal information available to third party advertisers, including
          information about your interests and preferences, to enable them to serve you more relevant ads.
        </p>
        <p> • Some of these third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising
          Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. NAI and DAA each provide information
          regarding procedures for opting-out of targeted online advertising from participating companies.
        </p>
        <p> • For mobile applications, you may be able to limit certain advertising practices using the settings on your mobile
          telephone, tablet, or other mobile device. On most mobile devices, you can install the DAA’s AppChoices app to make
          choices about cross-app interest-based advertisements from participating third parties.
        </p>
        <p> • BubbleApp uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze
          information about the use of the Site and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information
          regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources.
        </p>
        <p> Opting out through these mechanisms does not block all online advertising; you will continue to receive generic
          advertisements.

        </p>
        <p> Accessing Your Account
        </p>
        <p> Please note that if you choose not to provide us with certain personal information, we may not always be able to
          provide you with the relevant BubbleApp product or service that you request. For example, without providing an email
          address, you will not be able to create a Site account.
        </p>
        <p> • If you have a Site Account, you may access, view, correct, or update certain personal information collected about
          you, as well as deactivate or delete the account through the account services portal on BubbleApp.com or in the mobile
          application. Talent Users may also deactivate their account by contacting their BubbleApp talent representative.
        </p>
        <p> • If you have any concerns about how we are using your personal information, would like to access, correct, or
          delete the personal information that you have provided to us, please contact us.
        </p>
        <p> Retention Period
        </p>
        <p> When you request that we delete your personal information, we will take commercially reasonable steps to remove it
          from our active databases but will keep original information consistent with our business practices to the extent
          permitted by applicable law (for example, for purposes of dispute resolution, enforcement of agreements, complying
          with legal requirements, recordkeeping, backup, and document retention).
        </p>
        <p> Data Security
        </p>
        <p> BubbleApp takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the information submitted to us. However, no
          method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and you use our Site and
          transmit information to us at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Site, please contact us.
